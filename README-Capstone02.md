# ‚≠ê Capstone 02: Analysis of Airbnb Listings in Bangkok 2012-2022<br />

As part of the capstone project at Purwadhika BSD, I was tasked with assessing my data analysis skills by analyzing Airbnb listing data for the period 2012-2022.
My first step was to understand the dataset to:
<br />
1. Identify stakeholders to whom I will present my analysis.<br />
2. Identify the issues these stakeholders face.<br />
3. Formulate preliminary hypotheses that might address these issues.<br />
4. Provide evidence as to whether these hypotheses are supported by the data.<br />

After conducting basic analyses to understand the data, here is the context I developed.

**Objective of Analysis**

The objective of this analysis is to provide insights to listing owners, known as hosts, both those who are already operational and those considering starting operations. This is because I aim to provide reviews to hosts to improve the two most important aspects: sales and profits.

**Problem Statement & Provisional Hypotheses**

When discussing sales and profits, it is closely related to traffic and determining the optimal price. Therefore, I formulated several problems to be developed into questions to assist in data exploration.

**A. Sales Improvement -> Traffic**

   What makes customers choose a particular listing over others?
   In exploring this analysis, I use the key metric in the availability 365 column. This is because the lower the availability value, the more bookings a listing has, and vice versa.


**B. Optimal Profit -> Price**

   What is the optimal price that hosts can set, attracting interest while still generating profits?
   In exploring this analysis, I use the key metric of price. This is because the higher the price, the fewer customers want to book, and vice versa.
